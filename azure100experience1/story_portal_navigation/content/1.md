The content of these logs varies by resource type (for example, Windows event system logs are one category of Diagnostic Log for VMs and blob, table, and queue logs are categories of Diagnostic Logs for storage accounts) and differ from the Activity Log (formerly known as Audit Log or Operational Log), which provides insight into the operations that were performed on resources in your subscription.
